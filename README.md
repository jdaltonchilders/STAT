# Students Teaching About Teachers (STAT)
Students Teaching About Teachers was created as a concept for an online site to replace MSU’s paper-wasting teacher evaluation system. This site would show reviews and ratings for teachers at MSU by course number. All users would be able to search by teacher to find reviews or search by course and find a list of teachers who have previously taught that course. All users would also be able to pull up a teacher’s generic profile which includes the teacher’s name, the courses they taught, and their average rating. Logged-in users (verified through MyState) would have the ability to pull up a teacher’s detailed profile which shows the teacher’s name, the course they taught, their overall average rating, and average responses per question in the evaluation.
